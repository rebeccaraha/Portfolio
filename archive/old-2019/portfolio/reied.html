        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
            <p>The Re:IED project critically examined Rensselaer’s Engineering Education in order to design and develop a physical argument, a syllabus, against current Engineering Education methods. The Syllabus explored methods to create a more collaborative, engaging, and interdisciplinary experience while embracing Design Thinking and Engineering Education methodology. </p></div>

                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                      <p>There is an apparent trend towards reform in engineering education in the United States. Many engineering departments are developing innovative classes to address the problems facing the United States engineering industry. These problems and solutions are addressed at length in recent academic literature. Some of the research regarding engineering educational reform stems from an examination of the engineering education and industry of other countries that are more competitive than the US. In fact, this is one perceived problem – the United States’ lack of engineering talent compared to other nations. This is an important ranking because of the enormous correlation between economic health and engineering industry strength. Engineering industry in the United States places the blame of its failures partly on engineering educational institutions and their inability to adequately prepare students for professional careers. While many institutions aim to mitigate these problems with teamwork based engineering courses, much of the time their efforts fail. At Rensselaer, Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) falls into this category.</p>
            <p>With the project well defined through insight garnered from our literature reviews and own personal research, we created a plan to tackle the problems currently plaguing Rensselaer’s engineering education through the redesign of Rensselaer’s Introduction to Engineering Design.

                <h4>User Research</h4></div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>Once introductory literature research was done conducted, as a team we dissected Rensselaer’s approach to engineering in Introduction to Engineering Design. The course is Rensselaer’s way of tackling some of the current issues existing in engineering education, yet aims to incorporate many of the suggested strategies from academic research and literature. The course fails to affect positive change on the Institute, where some of the shortcomings arise from improper implementation of these strategies, while others are simply due to an absence of an attempted solution.</p>

                    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>After extensive research and interviews with students and faculty, we were able to distill four core reasons IED fails:</p>
                <ul><li>IED grades students on their measure of mechanical success.</li> 
                <li>IED does not encourage innovative behavior for students. </li>
                <li>IED does not equip students with the proper tools to be innovators and does not push students out of their comfort zone.</li>
                    <li>IED does not excite students about engineering.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>These four core problems, as well as many other facets of IED (including the class size, professors, and physical space) are not only negative to students’ engineering experience at Rensselaer, but are detrimental to their professional growth.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, we took a look at the current IED syllabus, explored break-frame engineering and design thinking education models, and sought out to develop a new course with a new syllabus that meets all of the learning outcomes through more engaging and impactful activities and educational experiences.</p></div>

           <h4>Course Description</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-sm-6">           <p>Rethinking Introduction to Engineering Design (Re:IED) is a piece exemplifying what the Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) course at Rensselaer could be, and how all of the same educational benchmarks can not only be met  – but exceeded – through more engaging and collaborative curricula that provides students with the proper environment to thrive as engineers. Where IED dissuades risk taking, punishes hard work when it fails, and leaves students with a disappointing view of what collaborative engineering work is, Re:IED does the opposite. Re:IED incentivizes calculated risk taking, teaches students that failure is a step on the way to success, and that engineering can be engaging, collaborative, and exciting.</p>
           <h4>Course Objectives</h4>
           <p>This course will teach students about the importance of teamwork and communications in the context of the engineering design process. Interactive engineering design and professional development exercises will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to innovative effectively as a team. Coursework is designed to challenge students to improve and expand upon your oral, written and visual communication skills, as well as their creative, critical thinking, and engineering abilities.</p></div>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><ul>
              <li>Students will have the capacity to solve engineering design problems, while instilling the importance of creativity in developing innovative solutions.</li>
                <li>Students will know how to identify customer needs, establish design objectives, and translate these into engineering design specifications.</li>
                <li>Students will exercise and improve important design skills of visualization, calculation, experimentation, and modeling.</li>
                <li>Students will have skills in organizing people and ideas for successful design.  Skills include teamwork, project management, verbal and written communication, and documentation.</li>
                <li>Students will be able to function on multi-disciplinary teams and communicate effectively.</li>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>By altering the course description, class structure, syllabus, and classroom design, we were able to meet and exceed all of IED’s original course objectives - which were left unchanged.</p>
            <p>The course was redesigned to focus on first year, first semester engineering students in excite them about the vast diverse opportunities available to engineers. Additionally, while all students may not go into engineering design, many students have an expectation that they will be building things when they get to engineering school and we want to fulfill that expectation. This desire to build worked perfectly with our desire to further engage students.</p>
            <p>Weekly themes were decided to ensure students properly learned the engineering design process and had an opportunity to explore the breadth of responsibilities engineers possess in the professional world. A teamwork model was created to ensure that students would work with peers within and outside of their own disciplines to ensure cross-function work, and a project structure was created to allow students to work on quick design and engineering activities as well as a long term project. A new classroom space was designed to enable a rapid prototyping. Movable desks were put in place to facilitate teamwork and a fluid environment.</p>
            <p>An exert from the final syllabus is below.</p></div>

                <h4>Key Insights &amp; Takeaways</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>Through redesigning Rensselaer’s Introduction to Engineering course, we were all able to grow as engineers and designers. The exercise not only allowed us to learn more about engineering and design thinking methodologies we had not been previously exposed to, but allowed us to deeply examine the areas we felt that we did not grow enough during our undergraduate education. This provided all three of us with growth areas to pursue post-graduation, whether in the professional workplace or through continued education.</p>
           <p>All literature research and ideation was conducted as a group for the Re:IED project. Additionally, the syllabus was accompanied by a Design Document outlining a literature review, methods, and implementation of the project - which was equally split as well.  My principal responsibilities included research and presentation of engineering and design thinking activities, final decision making on activities, and the final design and development for the Syllabus document. Despite having a strong background of design thinking methodologies before the project, this project enable me to greatly expand my own understanding of design thinking methodology and engineering education. </p></div>
