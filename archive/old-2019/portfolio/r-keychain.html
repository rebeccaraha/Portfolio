                <p>For that reason, I chose to print an R to mold and cast instead. The original 3D printed R, printed on a Form 2, can be seen after post-processing and sanding on the right.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <p>In order to cast, the two pieces of the mold were held together by a number of rubberbands and a resin mix was poured in. While pouring the mold was turned to a number of angles to ensure the resin reach all the segments of the R. The resin was poured through the pour hole until resin began to surface in the weap holes. Once sure that the resin had reached all areas of the R, it was left to sit for 2 to 3 hours to cure before taking the mold apart and checking on the casted piece.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h5>First Cast</h5></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><img src="../images/r-keychain/cast1-front.JPG" class="port-pic">
            <center><p>First Cast - Front</p></center></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><img src="../images/r-keychain/cast1-back.JPG" class="port-pic">
            <center><p>First Cast - Back</p></center></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <p>The first cast came out fairly well except for two considerations. First, there was a segment in the front that was not fully cured, despite it being left in the mold for four hours - indicating that the resin hadn't been properly mixed. Secondly, the back of the R (or the top side when pouring) had a lot of small bubbles, or a porous look. Another cast was poured to attempt to remedy these issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h5>Second Cast</h5></div>
             <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <img src="../images/r-keychain/cast2-front.JPG" class="port-pic">
                <center><p>Second Cast - Front</p></center></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <p>For the second cast, the resin was poured in the same way as it was the first time for the cast. However, this time the mold was banged against the table in order to get some of the bubbles out.</p>
                <p>As it can be seen on the right, this helped remove some of the bubbles, as compared to the first one, but still wasn't great. For this reason, another attempt was made.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h5>Third Cast</h5></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <p>The third cast was done with the same method as the first, except with more percusive action to remove the bubbles. Unfortunately, this ended up added bubbles to the resin, which can be seen on the right, and lead to a less-than-ideal cast.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h5>Four Cast</h5></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
                <p>In order to attempt to remedy the bubbling issue, one final cast was poured, with aid from the professor. For this pour, the resin was left to sit for a minute before pouring. The resin was then poured gradually, as in all of the other cases and bubbles were squeezed at (to the best of our ability).</p>
                <p>This pour garnered the most favorably results and was used for final piece.</p>
