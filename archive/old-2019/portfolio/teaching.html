            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>During my time at Rensselaer, I had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for the introductory Design, Innovation, and Society class, Product, Design, and Innovation: Studio I.</p>
                <p>The course introduces first-year students to Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodology and compliments another first-year course for the students which explores thes impacts of design and engineering on it's surronding society. In addition to exposing students to HCD methodology, it provides students with the opportunity to learn new visualization skills and explore 'creativity' as it relates to design and engineering. It is taught in tandem by an Engineering Professor, Social Science/Design Processor, and a Visual Comunication Design Professor.</p>
                <p>As a TA, I had the pleasure of leading the Design Thinking section of the course and supporting the three professors in the others. As the leader for the Design Thinking sections, I planned and conducted Design Thinking activities with the students to expose them to design thinking methodology.</p>
                <p>All activities were designed to provide students with tools that they could utilize throughout different stages of their design projects, while pushing them out of their comfort zones in order to teach students how to lean into the discomfort they may feel throughout the design process. Some of the design thinking activities done with students throughout my years of TAing are below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mockuptionary</li>
                    <li>Bodystorming</li>
                    <li>Mind-Mapping</li>
                    <li>How Can We</li>
                    <li>Affinity Mapping</li>
                    <li>Journey-Mapping</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br><br>
                <p>In addition to teaching students Design Thinking tools, I had the opportunity to support the Visual Communications leg of the course by providing one-on-one support for the Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign sections of the course - both during and after class periods. While I did not develop the material for these portions of the course, I did have the opportunity to lead the lecture portions of this segment and provide auxiliary learning materials and instruction which I created.</p>
