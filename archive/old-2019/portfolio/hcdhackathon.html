                <p>Last Fall, I had the pleasure of being the 'Wildcard Facilitator' at Carnegie Mellon's first Human-Centered Design Hack-a-thon - hosted by the Heinz School's Social Innovation club.</p>
                    <p>The HCD Hack-a-thon was a five-hour hack-a-thon experience where interdisciplinary teams were paired with local Social Impact Initiativies in order to tackle their biggest barriers.</p>
                         <p>As the only Wildcard Facilitator, my role was to float between groups and ensure they were on track with the timeline and aid them in moving forward. I aided teams in assessing what Design Thinking activities would help move their process forward and helped facilitated difficult discussions.</p>
                    
                    <p>The HCD Hack-a-thon enabled me to use seom Design Thinking activities in my wheel-house and practice facilitating groups without leading them in any certain diretion.</p></div>
