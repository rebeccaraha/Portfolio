            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>As an academic Design-Engineering hybrid, I've always been interested in the dynamic between Designers &amp; Engineers - both those who study and practice the two disciplines independently, as well as those, who conduct them in tandem.</p>
                <p>The research presented below began as an exploration of Designers + Engineers, which pivoted into a much different area of exploration. The initial objective of this research was as follows: to understand how engineers, designers, and engineer-design hybrids perceive one-another in the terms of each others' charactertistics and in the context of their work.</p>

                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>The initial research was envisioned as follows:</p>

                 <h6>Research Groups</h6>
                     <ul>
                     <li><b>Engineers</b> - with no first hand design experience</li>

              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Results &amp; Insights</h4></div>
                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>From this research, two major insights - based on this sample population - emerged:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Engineers don't have a strong understanding of what Designers do, but are still condescending towards their work or craft.</li>
                     <li>Engineers don't tend to think of Designers in the context of their own work - despite the fact that many of them work with Designers in some professional capacity.</li></ul>
                 <p>However, something even more interesting emerged throughout the duration of this initial session. The four participants, all great friends of mine, had no idea what I, a designer, studied academically or practiced profesionally.</p>
                 <p>The dearth of knowledge these four friends lead me to make the decision to pivot to a new research study. </p></div>
                 
        </div>
        <div class="borderline"></div>
             <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Pivoting: A New Study Objective &amp; Method</h4></div>
                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>Based on the previous experience with my friends, I decided to shift my focus and explore my friends' and family's perception of my academic and professional experience and competencies.</p>
                     <p>This new method, 'A Day in the Life, Children's Book' asked participants to create a children's book about what they imagined I did day-to-day, both while at school and while in the work force. Participants were provided with a digital or physical book template, depending on their prefence, and asked to complete two separate novels. </p>
              </div>
        </div>
        <div class="borderline"></div>
             <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Results &amp; Insights</h4></div>
                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>The enthusiasm and feedback from friends and family was overwhelming. Their excitement to help lead to creative and exciting expressions of what they envisioned my professional and academic life are like. All participants expressed themselves strongly but in differing ways. Some focused heavily on functional activities, others on auxilary activities, the flow of my day, and son. This diversity in responses was interesting and exciting to explore, alone.</p>
                     <p>Some experts from eight different books can be seen below.</p></div>

              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>From participants responses, an analaysis was done on frequency and duration of contact in comparison to understanding of my professional and academic work - as displayed through the activity. This graph was the analyzed by modes of contact.</p></div>
                   <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><img src="../images/methods/contact.jpg" class="port-pic"><center><p>Frequency &amp; Duration of Contact v. Understanding </p></center></div>

                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                  <p>From the research responses and analysis, three main insights were formed:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>My friends and family have high expectations for what I will achieve in my professional life.</li>
                     <li>My parents really understand what I do, but a lot of people who I've known from 5-10+ years do not. There is a correlation between Frequency &amp; Duration of Contact - but it is not as strong as expected.</li>
                     <li>My friends and family included a lot more information than just the scope of what work I do. This expanded scope and emphasis on the non-work portions of my life was very nice. It proved that even in the context of my work, I am more than just my work. (Also, all work and no play makes Rebecca a dull girl - after all.)</li>
                  </ul></div>   
              </div>
        <div class="borderline"></div>
             <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Adapating Methods</h4></div>
                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>The methods presented, while highly targetted in their exectuion could be easily adapted to meet a number of research needs based on the population and research area.</p>
                     <h5>Design a Doll, Design a Desk/Workstation, and Diary/Journal Entry</h5>
                     <p>The first set of methods (Design a Doll, Design a Desk/Workstation, and the Diary/Journal Entry) provide the necessary tools for participants to express their characteristic feelings about other groups in the context of work.</p>
                     <h6>Environment-Based Adaptation</h6>
                     <p>This method could be adapted to change the context (i.e.: to change from work to school, one could change the second activity from a desk to a locker).</p>
                     <h6>Before-and-After</h6>
                     <p>It also shows promise as a 'before-and-after' tool to aid users in confronting their mental models or biases. This could be achieved by having participants create a mental model of a person or group of people before meeting them and then once again after spending an amount of time with them. </p>
                     <p>The first set of activities could be compared with the second to uncover areas where users biases were challenged or changed and so on.</p>
                     <h6>Participant-Demographic Adaptation</h6>
                     <p>Last, but not least, these activities could be utilized with different participants who aren't as easily able to express their thoughts or feelings - such as children. It allows those who would not be able to articulate their mental models to express them in a non-verbal way.</p>
                     <p>In other cases, it would provide those who are unable to express their mental models through other traditional means to bring them to life, or even possibly discover mental models that they did not know they had, by personifying them. </p>
                     <h5>A Day in the Life: Children's Book</h5>
                     <p>Where the first set of activities focuses more on perception of characteristics and a shallow understanding of work resposibilities and attitudes, the second acivity (A Day in the Life: Children's Book) explores these work responsibilities and attitudes much deeper.</p>
                     <p>This activity is not without discomfort though. Many participants met the activity with apprehension as they felt that that deep knowledge wasnecessary to complete the activity. This was mitigated by instructing users to be creative, while realistic, about what they thought the subject truly did. They were encouraged to fill in assumptions where they were unsure and to provide as much detail or information they feel a children's' book would have.</p>
                     <p>This study is therefore much more suited for a finite research topic - as opposed to a high level overview or understanding. This activity could therefore be applied to a number of contexts including, but not limited to, some of the following:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>Understanding how students spend their time and possible stressors they have</li>
                     <li>How visitors interact with a new city</li>
                    <li>Decision-making processes for buying a car, a house, or other activity-intensive decisions</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p></p>
