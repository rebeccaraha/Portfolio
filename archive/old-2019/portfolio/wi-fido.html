                    <p>We generated our main insights from conversations with users that were both familiar with the set up at 4612 Forbes Ave and those that were not. We also observed a few subjects attempting to run different scenarios of use in order see where there were pain points. With this information we gathered what specific facets of the system were in need of a redesign based on user needs.</p>
                    <p>To supplement to the knowledge gained from users we also researched at the current offerings for podiums as well as connection methods to AV systems. Carnegie Mellon has developed its own internal software for connection but the lecterns are bought from outside supplier. Outside of the university one of the most popular lecterns is the Amplivox. This lectern allows users to play sound from a podium speaker easing the transition between smaller and larger spaces.</p>
                    <p>With this research we were able to draw out a comprehensive storyboard of the presentation process, in yellow, with all of the pain points in red. </p>
                    <p>From our storyboard, we conglomerated the information and fond the four most important pain points to tackle in our redesign. These areas were: too many wires, the screen getting in the way too often, podium clutter, and lack of support.</p>

A visual of these brainstorms can be seen on the right. The brainstormed ideas were then paired down, and the following solutions were chosen for each pain point.

                            In order to test the user interface of the AV system, a paper prototype of the interface was made. Before developing the prototype, key needs were mapped to key functionalities in order to understand that the AV system current does and what the AV system could do (e.g.: what features could be added). From here, a new system was designed - removing some unnecessary functionality, while adding additional functionality to improve the overall AV experience. This prototype was developed in Google Slides and then printed out - two to a sheet for testing.</p>

                            After the physical model was built, we conducted user testing for the podium model. As a team, we interviewed five people and received feedback from the users. Three main features were tested - control screen location, podium dimension, and angle.

Some users preferred the screen on the right side of the lectern base. While we understand this is due to most user testers being right handed, it is also notable that the majority of users overall will be right-handed as well - making in an important insight.

Users ranging from 5&#8217;2 to 6&#8217;3 were interviewed and the optimal height range was seen to be 40&#8221; to 43&#8221;, with 45&#8221; being the highest preference (40&#8221; was seen as optimal or the lowest possible by all users).

                    <p>The final UI was developed to be as simple and straightforward as possible. User feedback guided the screen selection feature, as well as the nomenclature for certain functionalities. User feedback also guided positioning of certain buttons and features.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the UI enables users to choose their views by dragging, change the volume and mic volumes, change the mode, and turn the system off and on. The final prototype does not include the volume change functionality as it was difficult to create a slider in Microsoft PowerPoint. Additionally, as it is impossible to create a dragging function in PowerPoint, the screen selection is only a click. The system assumes which screen the user would like.</p>

                        Lectern (previously a Podium)
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Through user testing, it was determined that a 3 inch range of movement, an embedded screen, and a laptop size podium were required features. Angles were determined to be not to be necessary - as laptops provide the necessary articulation with their screens - and was therefore removed; turning the podium into a lectern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final lectern model was developed to be a looks-like foam-core model. The details below outline the final desired design. As a team, it was decided that a visually stunning base was desired to allow the lectern to be a show piece and not allow the presenter to hide behind a large piece of furniture. Different visually appealing mechanisms that could lift and lower the 3 inches were brainstormed, researched, and debated, with an origami collapsible octagon being chosen. This base would contain a hydraulic actuation system which would allow the base to lock at 4 different heights (40&#8221;, 41&#8221;, 42&#8221;, 43&#8221;) and release when pressed down from the lowest height. The base is comprised of a metal frame with a fabric overlay.

                    <p>
                        The top of the lectern, which measures 21.5&#8221; by 17.5&#8221; with a 3&#8221; depth, allows the lid to be open in closed - where one can find all of the internal electronics. This enables users to open the lid to plug the battery for charging or fix any system errors. The top of the lectern is a opaque black glass cover with a plastic base. Lastly, a system screen is embedded in the system and can be accessed through a sliding mechanism. Once removed, the screen can pivot with two axises of motion. The screen measures 6&#8221; by 8&#8221;.
