            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>The Design Thinking for Kids project was conceptualized based on small principle: <span class="bodyunder">"Why weren't we exposed to Design Thinking and alternative frameworks for thought as children? Why is this only something you learn in <span class="special">very select</span> undergraduate settings?"</span> This question fueled our abmition and direction for the project.</p>

                 <p>Our team worked through <a href="http://designforamerica.com/process-guide/" target="_blank">Design for America</a>'s Design Thinking Process: Identify, Immerse, Reframe, Ideate, Build, and Test over the span of four months.</p>
                 <p>As we wanted to map our journey, for simplicity's sake, and in order to tailor the process to our time contraints and plans, we defined our project by four categories: Research, Synthesize, Strategize, and Test.</p></div>

                    <h4>Exploring the Opportunity Space</h4>    </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>As we were all designers and engineers, Design Thinking education was something that all effected us personally. We all spoke about our own educational experiences and converged at one question, “Why didn’t I know about Design Thinking sooner?” This question became exactly what we wanted to combat and the fueled our ambition for the project.</p>
                <h5>Listing Our Assumptions</h5>
            <p>To begin our understanding of Design Thinking, Design Thinking Education, and its importance, we began to list our assumptions. We questioned where design thinking could be important, why it was important, and even if it was important. These questions aided us in understanding not only why Design Thinking curriculum isn’t in place at a K-12 level, but how it could best be integrated.</p> 
                <h5>How Can We</h5>
            <p>Additionally, to aid in our scoping, we brainstormed ‘How Can We’ statements as well. After brainstorming individually, we converged as a group and came to a list of three priorities we wanted to tackle throughout the semester-long project:</p>
            <h6><span class="bodyunder">How Can We...</span></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>empower kids who lack creative confidence and access to tools and support?</li>
                <li>equip kids with the proper design thinking tools to help them gauge personal interest in design?</li>
                <li>prevent the split between “creative” and “non-creative” self-labeling?</li>
            </ul>
                
                <br><br>

        <p>Once we had assessed our assumptions and understood our initial scope, we moved forward to the research phase in order to better understand Design Thinking and K-12 educational models. These models include the current Rhode Island educational model, Common Core, Montessori Education, and a number of private school curricula. After understanding the primary methods of K-12 education, we took a deeper look into supplementary educational models and extra-curricular offerings.</p>
        <p>This research led us to speak with Jessica Artiles, a Graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology researching Design Thinking Education, and to touring DownCity Design in Providence, Rhode Island, a non-profit that utilizes the design process to teach students how to design and create their own products through the use of new tools and processes. Artiles spoke with us about her research and the importance of prototyping during the design process, while DownCity design showed us their space and spoke about many of the logistical considerations of facilitating these programs in the Providence area.</p>
        <p>After understanding Design Thinking and Design Thinking Education from the point-of-view of instructors, we worked to interview students from our own lives on their familiarity with, understanding of, and interest in these concepts to best understand where to go. At the same time, we began reaching out to additional Providence educational and design-centered initiatives to find the proper setting to test the findings from our research.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Implementation</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
        <p>After synthesizing our research, we found it most beneficial and impactful to work with students at the 9<sup>th</sup> grade level. Students at the 9<sup>th</sup> grade level are just beginning to think about what they want to do for a profession. We wanted to work with these students to open their eyes to alternate ways of learning and understanding, as well as alternate career options that are rarely spoken of at a high school level. Our initial implementation focused on the educating students on how a product is made, a system is conducted, etc. and then enabling them to take part in these processes on a smaller scale. This implementation was chosen in order to display to students the number of professional opportunities available as well as the benefit of utilizing alternate processes for research, synthesizing, and testing.  However, despite our extreme interest in working with this age group, we were unable to connect with an initiative able to give us some time to test our final implementation with this age group. For this reason, we had to rescope our implementation and testing.</p>
        <p>As we were most readily able to work with students from the 5<sup>th</sup> grade level, we created a plan around where they were in their educational  journey. The typical public school educational models tends to teach students that there is only one correct answer or method to tackle a problem, stunting creativity, innovation, and individuality. As a group we decided it was most important to combat this methodology as we wanted students to learn that there are a wealth of ways to tackle a problem. Additionally, we wanted to teach students about empathy on a base level and how to navigate constraints. We found the best method to teach these principals was the 5 Chairs activity. (Please see Re:IED Syllabus: Week 9 for details.)</p>
        <p>Overall, our workshop had mixed reactions. While some students were eager to take part in the activity, other students were disgruntled and vocalized their disinterest in participating throughout the project. For the most part, students disinterest waned when the activity progressed from paper and pen to physical building - strengthening the argument that education needs to be more hands on. During the debrief, students expressed that they enjoyed being able to not only create and build, but create something that didn’t have a right or wrong answer. Students felt empowered by their design process and wanted to share it with not only us but their parents - with many students taking their projects home with them at the end of the day.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">                     <p>While our work is presented here in a very clearly and concisely, this is not how the design process always goes, or how our design process progressed throughout the three month duration of our project. As we were in the beginning stages of the project, research was constantly conducted to ensure we were moving in the proper direction. Furthermore, we chose to test early and test often - as we found this feedback integral to our design and understanding. Therefore these, and other, steps were not conducted in a linear progression, but as needed and found to be illuminating to the project.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, while I am no longer in Providence and cannot participate in the project, it has been picked up by the Design for America (DFA) Chapter at Brown University for multiple semesters. Our research, testing, and contacts have created a foundation for this group and DFA intends on running the project for the foreseeable future.</p>
