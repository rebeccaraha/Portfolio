                    <p>In order to properly understand the problem space, initial research was conducted and findings were assessed. From there, the team chose to use the SET (Social, Economic, and Technology) Factors method of organizing everyone's findings. By categorizing research findings in three categories, the team was able to find trends and areas of opportunity.</p></div>

                    <p>After initial analysis of findings, the team brainstormed Product Opportunity Gaps (POGs) in order to understand potential focus areas. Once group members generated ideas, they were presented and affinity mapped. After the first round, another two rounds of brainstorming was conducted - this time in pairs. POGs were once again presented.</p>
                        <p>After three rounds of brainstorming, POGs were voted on once to eliminate undesirable POGs - leaving 16 POGs. Group members were then given seven votes each to disperse as they see fit on the remaining POGs. From here, 6 POGs remained.</p>
                    <p>A weighted matrix was utilized from here and after discussions based on the weighted matrix's results, three possible POGs were chosen:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Global Cuising Sharing</li>
                    <li>Kitchen Waste Use and Management</li>
                    <li>Space Management/Climate Control in Small Kitchens</li></ul>
                   <p>Finally, from these three 'Kitchen Waste Use and Management' was chosen.</p>

                   <p>Concepts for product and service solutions were brainstormed as a team using the 6-3-5 Method and Mockuptionary. (Check out the <span class="bold">Ideate &#8594; Build &#8594; Test</span> section of my <span class="bold"><a href="../process.html">Process</a></span> Page for more details!) Brainstorming was conducted independently and in pairs - as merit was seen in both methods.</p>
                <p>These concepts were presented, explored, and expanded upon to best understand their potential validity and relation to user insights. Once they were properly explored, concepts were informally voted on and narrowed down in two rounds to three concepts.</p>

                    <p>Based on the initial research, user interviews, and personas, concepts were brainstormed, developed, and debated. The team found a service model - where you could trade compost for farm goods more compelling and chose to move forward with that idea.</p>
                    <p>Different models of compost trading, for both reward structure and location, were explored. After speaking with more Millennials about their weekly shopping and social habits, it was decided that the model should fit into Millennial’s lives either effortlessly or as an excursion - to at least garner excitement - for this reason a Farmer’s Market was chosen as the trading location. Once the location was decided, further thought went into the item traded. Finally, a donut was chosen for two reasons: first, to garner excitement for Millennials, and second, because it was a low cost expense for farmer’s and after all... donuts are always in season (and relatively cheap for farmers to produce).</p>

                <p>A general model of the interaction was developed by the team and then stakeholder interviews were conducted at a farm, a farmer’s market, and the Phipp’s Botanical Garden - which also holds a weekly farmer’s market - to understand the viability of a service and the interest level of farmers for trading compost for a donut.</p>
                               <p>These interviews uncovered farmers' concerns while providing important information about whether or not farmers would participate in a program which traded raw waste for small incentives.</p>

                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <p>Stakeholder interviews validated our concept, while providing us with important areas to further explore. It was decided that raw waste would be traded - as opposed to compost - to enable Millennials to trade on a weekly basis and avoid any negative connotations about composting. From here, a final service model, seen on the left, and literature, seen below, were developed to educate and enable Millennials to easily trade raw waste for compost.</p>
