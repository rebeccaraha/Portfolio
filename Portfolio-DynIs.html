                  <h3>Designer's Block</h3> 
                   <h8>Designer’s Block is an ideation tool which enables designers to rapidly mock-up and communicate ideas as they progress through the early stages of their design process. Designer’s Block allows users to rapidly create, iterate, and scrap ideas with no waste and minimal clean up; creating a satisfying rapid prototyping experience and sustaining the momentum of users’ design processes.</h8><br /><br />

          <h4>capturing genius</h4>
                <h8>Moments of genius are fleeting and creative flow is fragile - when these moments occur, we must be ready to capture, communicate, and record these ideas as quickly as possible before they are gone. Communicating these ideas isn’t as easy as it should be and current paradigms for doing so leave a lot up to the interpreter’s imagination. Most mock-up methods for displaying ideas in a 3D space tend to be tedious, limiting, time-consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful. These methods slow down the process during the important initial ideation steps, and can lead to lost ideas or insights that can really hone in a project’s trajectory. A product that allows users to properly communicate their ideas at the moment of conception is imperative.</h8>
           <h4>prototyping</h4>
                <h8>Visual and functional prototypes were utilized to understand how users would interface with Designers Block, how pieces would physically react, and how the final prototype would be organized. Velcro, a peg and hole system, a friction based system, and magnets (both craft and neodymium) were all explored for the initial Designer’s Block Prototype. All of these were assessed by their pros and cons and magnets were determined to be the best possible choice. Craft magnets and neodymium magnets were both tested.<br>
                Once magnets were determined to be the best fastener method, rapid prototypes and mock-ups were made to determine size and shape considerations and magnet usage. The initial rapid prototypes were created from cardstock – one set with craft magnets and another with neodymium. The craft magnets proved they were way too weak early on, while neodymium magnets were too strong for the cardstock. As the cardstock was only to determine characteristics such as sizing and shape – as opposed to final materials – their abundance of strength was seen not to be an issue. <br>
                Once a fastener method had been finalized, four major materials were considered for the block material, these materials included: metal, glossy plastic, frosted plastic, and wood. All of these materials would have performed well under stress conditions, so the final material was determined based on what would give users the best user experience. Metal was forgone because of its cold exterior and sterile feel. Wood didn’t exude the personality we wanted Designer’s block to exude and didn’t have the tactile properties we were looking for. Plastic allowed for more freedom than the two previous materials, but had to be further examined. After intense examination and deliberation, frosted plastic at 50% opacity was chosen. The material had a nice finish whereas glossy plastic felt slippery and cheap. Half opacity was also chosen to create more visual interest and give the kit more of a ‘tool’ and less of a ‘toy’ feel.<br>
                The second iteration of block prototypes were made from laser cut frosted acrylic and embedded with the neodymium magnets. This material combination proved to be the perfect fit and have the right amount of ‘pull’ when connecting pieces. The second iteration prototype was then utilized for user testing and the ultimate design.</h8>
           <h4>user needs &amp; testing</h4>
                <h8>Through user testing, four main characteristics were desired to be tested. First and foremost, the quality. An important aspect of the user experience of Designer’s Block is that the user perceives Designer’s Block as a high-quality product, not a toy. It was desired that designers of all types would be interested in the product and not see it as a replacement for Legos or another building toy. Tactility was also an important factor. Once again, we wanted to ensure that Designer’s Block was seen as sophisticated tool, but even more importantly, it was important to ensure that people enjoyed touching, using, and creating with our products. It was necessary to create a product that people felt compelled to touch and use.<br>
                Additionally, we wanted to ensure that the block’s magnet pull was satisfying, Something that people would want to continually assemble and disassemble. Lastly, the most important characteristic was simplicity. Designer’s Block was created to allow designers to explain their ideas to others effortlessly, however we wanted to ensure the product did not inform designer’s ideation process by leading users to use certain pieces due to their interest in the eccentric or unique shapes. Simplicity was also important in ease of creation and iteration. We wanted to ensure designers could easily create, deconstruct, and rebuild in order to allow the design process to be fluid and continuous.<br>
                While user feedback didn’t directly address all of these concerns, two major conclusions were reached. First, the initial Designer’s Block sets users were given didn’t supply designers with the adequate number of rectangular prisms and cubes. Despite this, many users noted that the use of magnets was ‘entrancing’ and really peaked their interest in the product. By watching many users interact, it was apparent that the choice of magnets was a well-received one. These comments and additional user feedback informed the final design of Designer’s Block.</h8>
           <h4>designer’s block</h4>
                <h8>The final Designer’s Block Kit Design comes with an 82 piece set of building blocks in different shapes and sizes varying from .5 inches to 1.5 inches.
                All 82 pieces have been specifically chosen to give users the maximum potential for creation of their ideas without leading them to a final result. The 82 pieces come in a specially designed case made from a dark stained maple wood with foam padding and a metal plate attached to the opposite side of the lid. The metal plate allows for easy, yet secure, building and the case has been designed with aesthetics and portability in mind, so it can be proudly displayed on one’s desk but easily transported as well.<br>
                 Designer’s Block also grants their users the ability to buy expansion packs that specialize in different features, from various sizes to different shapes, to grow and personalize their Designer’s Block to their needs.</h8>
