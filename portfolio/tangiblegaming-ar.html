            <p>Our Tangible Gaming + Augmented Reality project began with a simple ask: explore the opportunities at the intersection of gaming and AR.</p><p> With that scope, our team of three worked nimbly and rapidly over two and a half weeks to explore the gaming and AR landscape and all of the opportunities that might exist. This all began with a question... well, a few...</p>

                <p>Is there an ideal demographic or game-type for AR integration?</p>
            <p>Are old school gamers open to the idea of technological integration?</p>
            <p>Does exisiting applications of AR integration help players to be more immersed in the game or is just a novelty?</p>
            <p>How can AR improve tangible gaming expriences are opposed to diluting them?</p>
                <p>What makes AR a true integration as opposed to a gimicky addition?</p></b>

            <p>Based on our Futurist Wheel we found many areas within Tangible Gaming and Augmented Reality to explore. As a team we decided to explore types of gaming before choosing an area to specify in - all beginning with research!</p></div>

            <h5>Narrowing Scope</h5>
            <p>Through this process it was determined that Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons were the best subjects for this study. They were chosen for two main reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having strong userbases with highly committed gameplayers</li>
                    <li>Complex gameplay that could be eased and augmented through Augmented Reality applications</li>

                <p>These complimentary research methods allowed us to create recommendations for the future of AR + tangible gaming.</p>
