                <p>As an Integrated Design Education Strategist, I design the future of design education with the <a href="https://designcenter.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Siebel Center for Design</a>. With a special focus on design research and integrated curriculums, I work closely with Rachel Switzky, the center's inaugural Director, to develop course curriculum and assets, as well as design research plans and protocols for academic and center-focused initiatives.</p>
            <p>To kick off my consultant work with the Siebel Center, I visited Urbana-Champaign for a one-week intensive with the SCD team!</p></div>

                <p></p>
            <p>For the first activity of the week, the core Siebel Center for Design team coordinated a Empathy exercise - bringing a dorm room to life in the Swanlund Administrative Building!</p>
            <p>The project, designed to provide administrators with a taste of what college dormitory life is like, was a quick design-sprint centered around bringing two personas alive - Bethany and Erica. Administrators and university staff were then welcomed into the space to experience what a modern-day dorming experience may be like, discuss their college experiences, and ultimately grow empathy for the college experience!</p>

            <p>During my week intensive, I had the pleasure of mapping out the syllabus and coursework for two courses:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>TE 401: Introduction to Design Thinking</li>
            <li>ECE 445: Senior Design w/ Design Thinking Overlay</li></ul>
            <p>Working collaboratively with the SCD team, I lead a set of interviews with students in both courses to understand their needs and expectations for both the course and beyond in future academic &amp; professional settings.</p>
            <p>From there, leveraging my integrated design education experience and professional experience, I worked with Rachel to develop both curriculums.</p>
            <p>The TE 401 curriculum focused on provided students with a deep dive into the Design Thinking process through three sprints - each designed to be a bit more intensive than the last. Where the ECE 445 course focused on complimenting a current course with a 'Design Thinking' overlay, which added value to the courses required work without providing an extra academic burden.</p>
            <p>During my week at UIUC, I also had the pleasure of being the introductory instructor to the ECEE 445 Design Thinking Overlay section of the course. It was an amazing experience!</p>
