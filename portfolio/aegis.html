            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>The Aegis Helmet was designed to prevent concussions and their long-lasting after-effects, most specifically in professional football. Instead of merely shopping players’ skulls from shattering, the Aegis was created with one simple intention: to lessen the shock player’s receive during impact by absorbing some of the force incurred.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Understanding Football and Concussions</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-7"><img src="../images/aegis/coup-counter.jpg" class="port-pic"></div>
           <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-5">
                <p>Before any ideation began, initial research was conducted to better understand the mechanical (or medical) and social causes of concussions.</p>
               <p>Concussion mechanics were explored to best understand how people physically get concussions, why the occur, and what their long term damage is. Once concussions were understood mechanically, the team heavily researched why concussions are as rampant of a problem as they are in the NFL, and what the real causes are. Both areas of research were highly enlightening and informed the project’s trajectory.</p></div>
              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>First and foremost, it was learned that concussions are due to the coup and countercoup effect, the injury that occurs at the site of the initial impact and the impact that occurs on the opposite area of the initial impact, respectfully. These coup/countercoup injuries in turn lead to players suffering from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and ultimately cause players’ mental states to degenerate - even long after they have left football.</p>
          
                <p>After understanding the mechanical causes of concussions, the empire surrounding the NFL was examined as well. When the team explored football’s rules and regulations, protective gear evolution, and overall history, a number of issues became apparent. First and foremost, football player’s injuries aren’t properly reported. As football players lose game time when they admit to injuries such as concussions, players and coaches tend to sweep these issues under the rug and never report them. This lack of reporting leads to no medical attention and ultimately, long lasting effects. Additionally, as football equipment has increased in safety, the sport itself has decreased as players begin to play more aggressively. The biggest discovery however was due to the timing of the team's research. As American football has only existed for a few decades and the long term consequences were starting to appear more prominently than ever. Both Ray Easterling and Junior Seau had committed suicide - due to depression caused by decreased mental function - during the span of the project, indicating this was an issue that needed immediate attention.</p>
                <p>The team came to one conclusion, while current helmets do a great job at protecting player’s heads from physical injuries such as punctures, they do not properly protect players from the physical impacts that lead to concussions.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>In order to best understand areas of improvement, current top-tier helmets were purchased and analyed.</p>
                <p>Helmets were systematically disassembled to understand the each pieces function in protecting the user's head. Different types of padding and bonnet structures became of most interest - as those pieces are the ones meant to absorb impact, and therefore prevent CTE.</p>
                <p>With a baseline understanding of the helmets functionality, the team was ready to start exploring materials and forms for better absorption. </p>
            </div>

        <div class="borderline"></div>
        <div class="row">       
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Material Testing &amp; Design</h4></div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>For this reason, the team decided to focus on the actual padding instead of a helmet, as opposed to the shell casing. This original research and testing began with a number of different materials to best understand which materials could best protect against these physical impacts. One of the first materials tested, were non-newtonian fluids. While these materials were found interesting for the unique material qualities, their stiffness under impact was not desirable for this application so the team moved on.</p>
                    <p>From there, the team began exploring other materials impact absorbing qualities. One of the main materials tested, and used for the first iteration of the Aegis helmet, was Sorbothane Shock Absorbing materials. A sample of one of these sheets can be seen above. Different configurations of Sorbothane were testing to allow the team to gauge what configuration would work best for the first iteration. Due to the lack of formal testing equipment at the team's disposable, absorption rates for each of the padding configurations had to be gauged by personal interaction with each.</p>
                        <p>After testing each configuration with ones' hands, by dropping items onto it, and any other novel way each team member found - the team came to a concencus that the design in the photo to the far right, cut pieces of Sorbothane mixed with a semi-viscous fluid in a plastic casing, was the best option. Despite being the best option, these were seen to be a little too mallebale, and for that reasons, this design was combined with the o-shaped ring for added support.
                            </p>
                    <p>Multiple balls of these configurations were created and then put into o-shaped rings. These were then connected to an existing bonnet from a deconstructed helmet.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, a bumber was added to the mask, which can be seen in the accompanying photo, of the helmet to aborb impact that a player may sustain from the front or below the chin.</p></div>

                <div class="col-sm 12 col-md-6"><p>Once a prototype was completed for the first iteration, impact testing was conducted to determine the success of the first iteration design. Three accelerometers were placed in the dummy head to measure impact, one at the front of the head and two on either side above each of the ears. These three points were chosen as they are noted to be the most critically impacted during football related injuries.</p>
                <p>With the use of accelerometers and a digital oscilloscope, testing on both the Aegis helmet and a Riddell Classic helmet was conducted to compare data. Both helmets were dropped from the same height multiple times at a number of the same orientations to collect data. The data from the two was compared.</p>
                <p>While the Aegis helmet did not absorb any more impact than the Riddell helmet - it showed promising results. Most importantly, the Aegis was on pair with the Riddell helmet when it came to impact results, indicating it was just as effective as dispersing impact. Additionally, the Aegis helmet was found to delay the impact when compared to the Riddell helmet. While players would have received the same amount of impact by wearing the Aegis, the results will very promising for a first iteration prototype and test.</p> </div>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                  <p>Unfortunately, due to time constraints a second iteration of the Aegis was not able to be made - however the project was a wide success. Throughout the design and development of the Aegis helmet, I was responsible for material testing and impact testing. These two specializations within the project team provided me with the invaluable experience of formal scientific testing.</p></div>
