            <p>In a (successful!) attempt to expand my skill-set and gain embedded systems experience, I took a Designing for the Internet of Things course. This sprint-based course provided students with hands-on design and development experience for IOT devices with a focus on both theory and application.</p>
            <p>This course not only provided me with invaluable technical skill-set but also enabled me to challenge the current way I approach and think about design.  Throughout this course, I worked on a number of projects, below is just a taste of some of the things I worked on!</p>

            <p>Pubbly Love was born out of a very interesting - and honestly midly uncomfortable - conversation about all of our own experiences with romantic relationships and the varied (sometimes backwards) trajectories they take. After much discussion, we realized as a team there is no 'typical' relationship - and that construct is becoming a more and more distant memory as we move forward.<p>
            <p>Due to this lack of common path relationships take in the 21st century, we've enterred an age of ambiguity which is difficult to navigate - and even more so difficult to navigate when separated from someone you are in a romantic relationship with. Pubbly Love was developed to fit perfectly in this space. </p>
            <p>The amount of water in Pubbly Love indicates your amount of interest in moving to the 'next step' - where a full vase indicates you're ready for the next step. Once you and your loved one are in the same range, you receive positive feedback (lights and bubbles) that your loved one feels the same and possibly ready for a chat if you both are vase-full!</p></div>
