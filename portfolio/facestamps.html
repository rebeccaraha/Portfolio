                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><p>Initially, real photos of the Radparvar family were desied for stamp making. To transition photos into stamp making images, they were brought into Photoshop and edited using the Threshold effect. Unfortunately, during this process, it was found very difficult to bring out the features desired through the use of Threshold and other Photoshop tools.</p>
                     <p>The best example from this process is seen on the right.</p>
                 <p>From there, the deicsion to use Bitmojis instead was made - as they allowed more decision and discretion about what features were desired and not desired.</p>

Once those pieces were removed, they were examined. Small adjustments were made to the cutting and engraving speed and power, and they were cut once again for a more finished look.</p>
            <p>After the second set of cuts, all of the pieces were washed to remove excess material from engraving. Wooden holders were then crafted by editing the stamp files to make them positives. The wooden holders were increased 7.5% in size and then cut.</p>
